// Heartbeat sink for otelcol-chopper data planes. Every stats interval each
// collector reports how many spans and log records it received and dropped
// since its last successful report; one FleetMetric row is inserted per
// report. Auth is the same fleet-scoped bearer token as the policy pull
// (src/lib/fleet-auth.ts).

// data-plane/processors/filterprocessor/engine.go):

//     "logs_received":    int64, "logs_dropped":    int64,
//     "metrics_received": int64, "metrics_dropped": int64
//   }

// Phase-4 collectors still in the field send { "received", "dropped" }; those
// are accepted and recorded as trace counts so a fleet can upgrade its
// control plane before its collectors. Pre-Phase-6 collectors simply omit the
// metrics_* keys, which read as 0 below.
//
// An all-zero body is still a valid heartbeat — it proves the collector is
// alive — so it is stored, not skipped.
